# Math Tools: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations

## Description
This repository holds various Linear Algebra/Differential Equation functions/solvers designed from scratch in Python. These functions were designed after content from a 2025 Spring LA/Diff. Eq. course.

## Contents
[linear_algebra_diff_eqs.ipynb](linear_algebra_diff_eqs.ipynb)

[linear_algebra_diff_eqs.py](linear_algebra_diff_eqs.py) - utils only

## How to Run
The `.ipynb` files (Jupyter Notebooks) can be run from top to bottom. 

The `.py` files contain the utils for calculations. One can import these functions for use in other projects.

## What One Will Learn
This project challenged me to design and implement algorithms that tackled what I learned in my LA/Diff. Eq. course.
