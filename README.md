# Math Tools: Applied Mathematical Methods

## Description
This repository holds various applied mathematical functions and solvers designed from scratch in Python. Topics covered include: linear algebra, differential equations, vector calculus, and complex calculus. These functions were designed after completing various courses.

## Contents
[linear_algebra_diff_eqs.ipynb](linear_algebra_diff_eqs.ipynb)

[linear_algebra_diff_eqs.py](linear_algebra_diff_eqs.py) - utils only

(Currently implementing assorted algorithms from vector/complex calculus!!!)

## How to Run
The `.ipynb` files (Jupyter Notebooks) can be run from top to bottom. 

The `.py` files contain the utils for calculations. One can import these functions for use in other projects.

## What One Will Learn
This project challenged me to design and implement algorithms that tackled what I learned in various courses (e.g. Multivariable calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Applied Mathematical Analysis: Vector and Complex Calculus).
