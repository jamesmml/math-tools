# Math Tools: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations

## Description
This repository holds various Linear Algebra/Differential Equation functions/solvers designed from scratch in Python. These functions were designed after content from a 2025 Spring LA/Diff. Eq. course.

## Contents
[MathTools.ipynb](MathTools.ipynb)

[MathTools.py](MathTools.py) - utils only

## How to Run
The `.ipynb` files (Jupyter Notebooks) can be run from top to bottom. 

The `.py` files contain the utils for calculations. One can import these functions for use in other projects or one can use them as standalone scripts.

## What One Will Learn
This project challenged me to design and implement algorithms that tackled what I learned in my LA/Diff. Eq. course.
